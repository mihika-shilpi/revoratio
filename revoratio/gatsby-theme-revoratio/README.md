# Introduction

Revoratio is a Gatsby Theme made for those of you who need to build **brand guidelines**. Whether you're building this for your own brand, or you're a designer who needs to build brand docs all the time, this theme should give you the base framework you need. 

You'll need some familiarity with starting up a gatsby project, a decent grip of editing a few code files (guided in the theme guide) and comfort with Markdown. 

We'd be happy to know if you have any thoughts or suggestions for additions!
