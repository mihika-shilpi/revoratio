## Fonts

All communication and creatives use only two fonts: EIL Serif and EIL Sans Serif (based off of Gotham).

<Grid gap={2} columns={2}>
  <BrandFont 
    fontName="Montserrat"
    fontFamily="Montserrat"
    />
    <BrandFont 
    fontName="Playfair Display"
    fontFamily="Playfair Display"
    />
</Grid>

**EIL Sans**

<Text

    fontFamily: 'Montserrat',
    fontSize: 4,
    fontWeight: 'light',
  }}>
  Hello

EIL Serif

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/EIL_Bold2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/EIL_Bold2x.png)

Do not use deprecated versions of EIL (Bold, Display, etc.)

Most creative work and communication will use EIL Sans. EIL Serif is to be used selectively, in low volume and large scale only. It may be used for level 1 titles, to accentuate names or as decorative type. It is never used in all UPPERCASE.

## Styles

The below are a series of suggested styles of typography. They are not exhaustive. Nor should all designs use all these styles at once. Combine a minimum of styles to maximise communication hierarchy.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Top_title2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Top_title2x.png)

This is usually used as a top level title, never more than once in a single creative. Make not of relatively tight tracking and leading on these fonts.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Secondary_title2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Secondary_title2x.png)

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Tertiary_titlE2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Tertiary_titlE2x.png)

Always in uppercase.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Leading_or_subtitle_text_usually_runningover_two_or_more_lines2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Leading_or_subtitle_text_usually_runningover_two_or_more_lines2x.png)

This is one of the rare uses of the ‘light’ version of EIL Sans. Used under top level titles, or before main body text in documents and written digital communication. It is intended to contain the main message of the proceeding paragraphs.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Banded_Text2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Banded_Text2x.png)

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/BandSettings2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/BandSettings2x.png)

Used in a variety of colours, but always the same style,  height, and black underline; only with EIL Sans Bold. 
This is a style used either for titles or for links (digital) that are ‘invitations’ to discover other pages. 
Make special note of the spacing around the text, which defines the size of the ‘band’. Also note that the ‘underline’ is the thickness of the lowercase letter I in EIL Sans Bold at the given font size.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Body_-_Lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet_consectetur_adipiscing_elit._Fusce_et_tempus_nisl_et_eleifend_magna._Donec_ut_risus_luctus_egestas_nisl_accumsan_finibus_lorem.2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/Body_-_Lorem_ipsum_dolor_sit_amet_consectetur_adipiscing_elit._Fusce_et_tempus_nisl_et_eleifend_magna._Donec_ut_risus_luctus_egestas_nisl_accumsan_finibus_lorem.2x.png)

Body text **always** uses EIL Sans Book. Do not set body entirely in bold text, although it may be used to highlight content. Also do not set any body text in Light, it is illisible. In terms of text decoration, you may used underline, or ~~strikethrough~~. Italics is not used. 
Make note of the proportion between font size and leading: 1:1.5 is the minimum ratio. 
Also note that for large blocks of text (50+ words), we always maintain width to have 10-12 words a line.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/2x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/2x.png)

Note that quote marks are always displayed in EIL Serif, although the quote itself is not.

## Compositions

The below are some examples of how composition is used to make titles with the EIL typography. Please make special note of permitted colour use (only bands, not text), of the use of EIL Sans Bold uppercase, selective used of EIL Serif, equidistant spacing around text in bands, and weight of ‘stroke’ or ‘underline’.


Occasional use of EIL Serif for large type

White bands, when followed by a black, are the only ones which can take a coloured underline.

Multiple bands can be stacked together to create hierarchy. But they must all be ‘stuck’ to each other.

<GatsbyImage image="../../images/Intuit/Typography/TypeOk1.png"/>

Text is ONLY ever in EIL Black or white, whichever maximises contrast with the background.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeOk_32x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeOk_32x.png)

EIL Black or white bands may be used without underline.

Coloured bands MUST have an underline in EIL Black. 

Each ‘composition’ may use only 1 colour in addition to EIL Black and white.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeOk_42x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeOk_42x.png)

Bands may be scaled and ordered as to create hierarchy. However, refrain from having more than 3 band heights.

EIL Serif can be used for the school name. It is never in uppercase.

You may have noticed that these compositions present a great variety of possibilities, and ultimately, rules such as underline weight = l width; or padding = n height, are difficult rules to follow once hierarchy and multiple type scales are introduced. This is true, and we rely on creatives to use their best judgement when creating titles.

**Here are some things you should AVOID.**

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_12x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_12x.png)

Coloured borders on non-white bands.

Coloured text

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_22x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_22x.png)

2 rows of bands at exactly the same width. Rework the word break in this case. There should be a visible difference in width. Also avoid ‘small’ differences that look like an error.

A single block that has a break between bands. Bands must be stuck together.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_32x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_32x.png)

ANY sort of asymmetric application of the bands behind text. There are some versions of this that are obviously off (such as on the left). 

That said all symmetry is not metric (measured). You are likely to find that, especially at smaller scales, for it to appear to be symmetric, the top and bottom padding is different from the left and right. Use your best judgement, but ensure that it is visually symmetric.

![Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_42x.png](Typography%200199851c820b412683492bc0a04cde69/TypeNo_42x.png)

Run on text — these are not bands for paragraphs, but per line. Width should be applied per line, underline should be applied per line. There are never multiple lines of text in one band (exception, dates).
