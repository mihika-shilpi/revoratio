As you have already disovered, this theme lets you write your guidelines in MDX. We have set up some basic styling for MDX, which you can override by creating and editing `src/gatsby-theme-reovratio/styles/global.js`. 

Here is a preview of the major styles (which you can use to preview your theme style and colour changes!).

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

### Body text 

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

### Lists 

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
4. And another item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks

You can also use inline HTML and any of the components in the theme guidelines within your markdown files.
