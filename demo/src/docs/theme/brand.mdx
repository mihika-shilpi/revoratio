As a theme made for brand guidelines, we've put together some custom components that you will most likely need to to build up brand guidelines< Colours, Fonts and other essentiels!
Like everything else in the theme, you can shadow the component files to customise them, but we've integrated a lot of styling `props` into the components themselves, so you have plenty to work with. 


## Box

A very basic component, the box allows lots of customisation. It takes MDX and component content within it. 
You can add background colours, your own text styles and colours -- to display your brand content. Not that text styling will only apply to direct children - not components or html within the box. 

<Grid columns={2} gap={2}>

``` 
<BrandBox> This is a box </BrandBox>
```
<BrandBox> This is a box </BrandBox>

</Grid>

| Prop | Control |
|:---|:---|
|color| Content/type color|
|font| Font of the content|
|fontSize| Content font-size|
|fontWeight | Content font-weight|
|case| Content text-transform|
|Background | Adds a background to the box and padding within it|
|extraSpace | Set this to true to add larger padding |

<Grid columns={2} gap={2}>

``` 
<BrandBox
    color= '#2222ff'
    font= 'Playfair Display'
    fontSize= '32px'
    fontWeight= '400'
    case= 'lowercase'
    Background= '#f3f3f3'
    extraSpace= {true}
    > This is a box </BrandBox>
```
<BrandBox
    color= '#2222ff'
    font= 'Playfair Display'
    fontSize= '32px'
    fontWeight= '400'
    case= 'lowercase'
    Background= '#f3f3f3'
    extraSpace= {true}
    > This is a box </BrandBox>

</Grid>

## Rule 

As with all guidelines, you will have to mark things as do and don't do. So we have a specific rule component. 

<Grid columns={2} gap={2}>

``` 
<BrandRule> This is a rule </BrandRule>
```
<BrandRule> This is a rule </BrandRule>

</Grid>

| Prop | Control |
|:---|:---|
|do| Defaults to true - a 'do' rule. Set to false to get a cross.|
|Background| Default false, you can switch this to true to highlight your rule|
|font| Font of the content|
|fontSize| Content font-size|
|fontWeight | Content font-weight|

<Grid columns={2} gap={2}>

``` 
<BrandRule
    Background= {true}
    do= {true}
    > This is a rule </BrandRule>
```

``` 
<BrandRule
    Background= {true}
    do= {false}
    > This is a rule </BrandRule>
```

<BrandRule
    Background= {true}
    do= {true}
    > This is a rule </BrandRule>

<BrandRule
    Background= {true}
    do= {false}
    > This is a rule </BrandRule>

</Grid>

## Font

Display your brand fonts with the font component.


``` 
<BrandFont
    font="Montserrat"
    fontName="Name of font" />
```
<BrandFont
    font="Montserrat"
    fontName="Name of font" />


| Prop | Control |
|:---|:---|
|font| Font of the content|
|fontName| Optional font label below|
|light | Set this to true to display the font in grey|

---

## Color

Display color snippets with colour data using this component. It requires that you have HEEX values for your colours. If you need to add a custome row, such as Pantone or other colour codes, you can shodow and edit the component. 

<Grid columns={2} gap={4}>

```
<BrandColor 
    colorName = "Revoratio"
    colorHex = "#0064FF"
    colorRGB = "0, 100, 255"
    colorCMYK = "77, 48, 0, 0"
/>
```

<BrandColor 
    colorName = "Revoratio"
    colorHex = "#0064FF"
    colorRGB = "0, 100, 255"
    colorCMYK = "77, 48, 0, 0"
/>
</Grid>

| Prop | Control |
|:---|:---|
|colorName| The Name you want displayed for your color|
|colorHex| This HEX value is both displayed and affects the background colour of the card|
|colorRGB | A string  of RGB values |
|colorCMYK | A string  of CMYK values |
|flex | Set this to 'row' to display colour values on the right of the card |

## Caption

All guidelines need annotations and captions. This component offers a faded, smaller font sized caption with a limited width, to add explanatory notes to you examples. 

<Grid columns={2} gap={4}>

```
<BrandCaption> This is caption text </BrandCaption>
```

<BrandCaption> This is caption text </BrandCaption>

</Grid>
